<h1>Nursultan Nazarbayev</h1>
<p style="border: 2px solid Violet;">Nursultan Nazarbayev is the first President of Kazakhstan and the Elbasy, elected on December 1, 1991 at the first national elections. The personality of N.A. Nazarbayev marks a whole epoch in the life of the country.

The mission of awakening the national spirit and reviving our statehood fell on the shoulders of one of the titans of modern global politics — Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose gigantic figure will serve as an unshakable guide for grateful descendants for centuries.

It was to him at the dawn of independence that our people entrusted the design and construction of a new Kazakhstan. Time has proved the correctness of this fateful choice.

The content and essence of his multifaceted activities to create the foundations of genuine sovereignty, build an effective economy, form a harmonious society and determine the priorities of the country's development at the latest stage of national history is a strong argument for recognizing the First President of Kazakhstan as the founding father of our modern statehood and the true Leader of the nation.

The historical phenomenon of Nursultan Nazarbayev is that he managed to consolidate the creative potential of the nation and mobilize society for a powerful breakthrough into the future, which received a figurative name in the world — "the leap of the Kazakhstan leopard".

Yelbasy's purely pragmatic approach, which presupposes concrete actions, maintaining the stability of the entire system, strategic planning and gradual development, has allowed our country to achieve impressive results in state-building in less than 30 years. Thanks to the continuous process of transformation and deep systemic reforms in all spheres of society, the world has started talking about the "Kazakhstan miracle", the main creator and author of which is Nursultan Nazarbayev.

The thoughtful policy and character of Elbasy led the economy of Kazakhstan to the status of one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Thanks to the personal contribution of the First President and strong popular support, the "Kazakhstan model of Development" has become widespread in the world community. This model consists in the gradual and confident development of the state according to a deeply thought-out course.</p>
